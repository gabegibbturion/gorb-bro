# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Applied âœ…

## Problem Solved

The issue was caused by a **conflicting Jekyll workflow** that was interfering with our custom Vite deployment.

## What I Fixed

1. âœ… **Removed** the conflicting `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` workflow
2. âœ… **Added** `enablement: true` to `deploy.yml` to auto-enable Pages
3. âœ… **Kept** only the correct `deploy.yml` workflow for Vite

## Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push These Changes

```bash
cd /home/ggibb/Desktop/code/CesiumReact

# Check what changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment - remove Jekyll workflow"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin master
```

### 2. Watch the Deployment

Go to: https://github.com/gabegibbturion/gorb-bro/actions

You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running successfully now!

### 3. Your Site Will Be Live At

**https://gabegibbturion.github.io/gorb-bro/**

(after 2-5 minutes)

## What Was Wrong?

GitHub automatically created a Jekyll workflow when Pages was first enabled. This conflicted with our custom Vite deployment workflow because:
- Both workflows tried to deploy to the same Pages site
- The Jekyll workflow was looking for Jekyll files (which don't exist in a Vite project)
- This caused the "Pages not enabled" error

## Current Setup

Now you have **ONE** workflow: `deploy.yml`
- âœ… Builds your Vite project from `test-three/`
- âœ… Automatically enables GitHub Pages
- âœ… Deploys to `https://gabegibbturion.github.io/gorb-bro/`
- âœ… Triggers on every push to `master`

## Verification

After pushing, check:
1. **Actions tab**: Workflow should run without errors
2. **Settings â†’ Pages**: Should show "Source: GitHub Actions"
3. **Live site**: Should load at the URL above

## No More Manual Steps!

From now on:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin master
```

Site updates automatically! ðŸš€
